# Get-FasCertificateDefinition

List or view existing Certificate Definition objects (recipe for issuing a certificate).

## Syntax

`Get-FasCertificateDefinition [-Name <String>] [-Address <String>] [-UserName <String>] [-Password <String>] [<CommonParameters>]`

## Detailed Description

View the configuration of existing Certificate Definition objects that the FAS is using to generate certificates. When generating a certificate, the FAS requires various pieces of information. Including:
-  The CertificateTemplate to request (see Get-FasMsTemplate)
-  A list of loadbalanced/failover Certificate Authority Addresses (see Get-FasMsCertificateAuthority)
-  A reference to the AuthorizationCertificate to use to Authorize the request (see Get-FasAuthorizationCertificate)
-  A list of additional Issuance Policy OIDs to add to the certificate request (see Get-FasPolicyOid)
-  A flag indicating if the certificate can be used as an in-session Virtual Smart Card, or only for the logon process. Note that Certificate Definition objects can only be created and managed by the FAS Server administrator, although they can be referenced by "Rule" administrators.
